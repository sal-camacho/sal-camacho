Entry-Level Security Analyst with a disciplined, detail-driven approach rooted in a military background. I bring hands-on experience in risk assessment, threat analysis, and security monitoring, supported by a strong foundation in team training and structured evaluations. My transition into cybersecurity is fueled by a passion for protecting organizations, backed by tactical thinking and precision.

Iâ€™m currently advancing through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, building practical knowledge in network defense, ethical hacking, and vulnerability management. My work reflects a commitment to operational security, rigorous documentation, and smart risk mitigation across critical systems.
